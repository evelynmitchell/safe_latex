SAFE LaTeX
==========

LaTeX Templates for SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) Term Sheets.

Paul Graham and yCombinator have recently created and publicly recommended
the usage of SAFEs over convertible debt notes. More information about SAFEs
can be found here: <http://ycombinator.com/safe/>

Introduction
------------

This project aims to make the process of making term sheets for your startup
easier. Creating these documents through LaTeX makes it much easier to create
professional looking PDFs and only requires modification of a single file.
This file can also be generated through a script to allow users to create
multiple documents from a list of investors.

Usage
-----

First setup a TeX system on your computer, or use an online TeX compilation
service. An example using WriteLaTeX can be found here:
<https://www.writelatex.com/600523mgkrqs>.

Then modify the variables.tex file for your company's requirements. Each of
the safe_*.tex files in the root of the project build term sheets for the three
possible combinations of terms.
