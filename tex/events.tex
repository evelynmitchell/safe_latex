\subsection{Equity Financing}
\label{sec:equityfinancing}

\FinancingTerms{}

In connection with the issuance of SAFE Preferred Stock by the Company
to the Investor pursuant to this Section~\ref{sec:equityfinancing}:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

\item {
\begin{sloppypar}
    The Investor will execute and deliver to the Company all
    transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; provided,
    that such transaction documents are the same documents to be
    entered into with the purchasers of the Standard Preferred Stock,
    with appropriate variations for the SAFE Preferred Stock;
\end{sloppypar}}

\item {The Investor and the Company will execute a Pro Rata Rights
    Agreement, unless the Investor is already included in such rights
    in the transaction documents related to the Equity Financing; and}

\item {This instrument will expire and terminate.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Liquidity Event}
\label{sec:liquidityevent}

If there is a Liquidity Event before the expiration or termination of
this instrument, the Investor will, at its option,
either (i) receive a cash payment
equal to the Purchase Amount (subject to the following paragraph)
or (ii) automatically receive from the Company a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the Purchase Amount divided by the
Liquidity Price, if the Investor fails to select the cash
option. Thereafter, this instrument will expire and
terminate.

\begin{sloppypar}
In connection with Section (b)(i), the Purchase Amount will be due and
payable by the Company to the Investor immediately prior to, or
concurrent with, the consummation of the Liquidity Event. If there are
not enough funds to pay the Investor and holders of other SAFEs
(collectively, the “\textbf{Cash-Out Investors}”) in full, then all of
the Company’s available funds will be distributed with equal priority and
\emph{pro rata} among the Cash-Out Investors in proportion to their
Purchase Amounts, and the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid
Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price.  In connection with a
Change of Control intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization,
the Company may reduce, \emph{pro rata}, the Purchase Amounts payable
to the Cash-Out Investors by the amount determined by its board of directors
in good faith to be advisable for such Change of Control to qualify as
a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and in
such case, the Cash-Out Investors will automatically receive the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the remaining unpaid
Purchase Amount divided by the Liquidity Price.
\end{sloppypar}

\subsection{Dissolution Event}
\label{sec:dissolutionevent}

\begin{sloppypar}
If there is a Dissolution Event before this instrument expires or
terminates, the Company will pay the Investor an amount equal to the
Purchase Amount, due and payable to the Investor immediately prior to,
or concurrent with, the consummation of the Dissolution Event. The
Purchase Amount will be paid prior and in preference to any
Distribution of any of the assets of the Company to holders of the
Company’s capital stock by reason of their ownership of such stock. If
immediately prior to the consummation of the Dissolution Event, the
assets of the Company legally available for distribution to the
Investor and all holders of all other SAFEs (the “\textbf{Dissolving
Investors}”), as determined in good faith by the Company’s board of
directors, are insufficient to permit the payment to the Dissolving
Investors of their respective Purchase Amounts, then the entire assets
of the Company legally available for distribution will be distributed
with equal priority and \emph{pro rata} among the Dissolving Investors
in proportion to the Purchase Amounts they would otherwise be entitled
to receive pursuant to this Section~\ref{sec:dissolutionevent}. After
the payment, or setting aside payment, to the Investor, this
instrument will expire and terminate.
