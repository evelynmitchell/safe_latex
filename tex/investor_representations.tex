\item {\begin{sloppypar}The Investor has full legal capacity, power and authority to
    execute and deliver this instrument and to perform its obligations
    hereunder. This instrument constitutes valid and binding
    obligation of the Investor, enforceable in accordance with its
    terms, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other laws
    of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
    creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity\end{sloppypar}}

\item {The Investor is an accredited investor as such term is defined
    in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Investor
    has been advised that this instrument and the underlying
    securities have not been registered under the Securities Act, or
    any state securities laws and, therefore, cannot be resold unless
    they are registered under the Securities Act and applicable state
    securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration
    requirements is available. The Investor is purchasing this
    instrument and the securities to be acquired by the Investor
    hereunder for its own account for investment, not as a nominee or
    agent, and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with,
    the distribution thereof, and the Investor has no present
    intention of selling, granting any participation in, or otherwise
    distributing the same. The Investor has such knowledge and
    experience in financial and business matters that the Investor is
    capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such investment, is
    able to incur a complete loss of such investment without impairing
    the Investor’s financial condition and is able to bear the
    economic risk of such investment for an indefinite period of
    time.}
